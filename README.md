# Online-Shopping-Cart-Simulator
Description: This program is a simple online shopping cart simulator. It has the capabilities to hold up to two items in a user's cart and will display the total cost.
Future plans: Build on this program to allow the user to add more items (up to 99?) using a vector and displaying the total of the entire cart rather than a hard limit of two items.
